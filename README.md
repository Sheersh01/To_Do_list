# To_Do_list
Overview:
This project aims to create a simple and interactive to-do list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application will allow users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them from the list.

Features:

Add Task:
Users can input a task in a text field and press Enter or click a button to add it to the list.
Display Tasks:
All added tasks will be displayed in a list format, showing the task name and an option to mark it as complete.
Mark Task as Complete:
Users can mark a task as complete by clicking a checkbox or a button associated with each task. Completed tasks will be visually distinguished from incomplete tasks.
Remove Task:
Users can remove a task from the list by clicking a delete button or icon associated with each task.
Persist Data:
The application should store tasks locally so that when the user reloads the page, their tasks are still visible.
Implementation:

HTML:
The HTML structure will include input fields for adding tasks, a list to display tasks, and appropriate buttons for marking tasks as complete and removing them.
CSS:
CSS will be used for styling the application, including layout, colors, typography, and button styles. It will also handle responsiveness for different screen sizes.
JavaScript:
JavaScript will handle the dynamic functionality of the application, such as adding tasks to the list, marking tasks as complete, removing tasks, and storing tasks locally using web storage APIs like localStorage.
Additional Considerations:

Accessibility: Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by implementing proper keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
Error Handling: Provide meaningful error messages and handle edge cases gracefully, such as empty task submission.
User Experience: Focus on creating an intuitive and seamless user experience by providing feedback for user actions and optimizing performance.
Testing: Perform thorough testing to ensure the application functions correctly across different browsers and devices.
Conclusion:
This project will result in a functional and user-friendly to-do list application that demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive web interfaces. It serves as a practical example for beginners learning web development concepts and techniques.
